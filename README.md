# ListDetailPost
## Description
App made for showing android skills.

This is more or less a summary about what you can find in the project:
- Presentation layer with MVVM pattern.
- Using of UIState modeling.
- Using of Flows and StateFlows.
- Comunnication with Rest Api through Retrofit.
- Clean architecture layers separation by modules.
- Dependency Injection with Hilt.
- Some small custom view.
- Basic Error Handing with Either.
- Cache support with Room.
- Unit Testing, Integration Testing and some UI Testing (JUnit, Mockito, MockWebServer, Espresso).

## Motivation and Context
Tries to follow clean architecture approach including latest android trends.

The less interesting part in the app is the poor design and the feature itself because is just a list-detail example, but I decided not to focus in the interface.
